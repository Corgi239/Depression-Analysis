However, what factors of peer support lead to favorable psychosocial outcomes for individuals is less clear. Using a dataset of over 300K posts by ∼39K individuals on an online community TalkLife, we present a study to investigate the effect of several factors, such as adaptability, diversity, immediacy, and the nature of support. Unlike typical causal studies that focus on the effect of each treatment, we focus on the outcome and address the reverse causal question of identifying treatments that may have led to the outcome, drawing on case-control studies in epidemiology. Specifically, we define the outcome as an aggregate of affective, behavioral, and cognitive psychosocial change and identify Case (most improved) and Control (least improved) cohorts of individuals. Considering responses from peers as treatments, we evaluate the differences in the responses received by Case and Control, per matched clusters of similar individuals. We find that effective support includes complex language factors such as diversity, adaptability, and style, but simple indicators such as quantity and immediacy are not causally relevant. Our work bears methodological and design implications for online mental health platforms, and has the potential to guide suggestive interventions for peer supporters on these platforms.}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Saha, Koustuv and Sharma, Amit}, year={2020}, month=may, pages={590–601}, language={en} }

Late-life depression (LLD) is associated with a decline in physical activity. Typically this is assessed by selfreport questionnaires and, more recently, with actigraphy. We sought to explore the utility of a bespoke activity monitor to characterize activity proﬁles in LLD more precisely.
Method. The activity monitor was worn for 7 days by 29 adults with LLD and 30 healthy controls. Subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and quality of life (QoL) (36-item Short-Form Health Survey) and activities of daily living (ADL) scales (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale) were administered.
Results. Physical activity was signiﬁcantly reduced in LLD compared with controls (t = 3.63, p < 0.001), primarily in the morning. LLD subjects showed slower ﬁne motor movements (t = 3.49, p < 0.001). In LLD patients, activity reductions were related to reduced ADL (r = 0.61, p < 0.001), lower QoL (r = 0.65, p < 0.001), associative learning (r = 0.40, p = 0.036), and higher Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score (r = −0.37, p < 0.05).
Conclusions. Patients with LLD had a signiﬁcant reduction in general physical activity compared with healthy controls. Assessment of speciﬁc activity parameters further revealed the correlates of impairments associated with LLD. Our study suggests that novel wearable technology has the potential to provide an objective way of monitoring real-world function.}, number={1}, journal={Psychological Medicine}, author={O’Brien, J.

We included approximately 11 000 cohort members with information on depressive symptoms or frequency of physical activity at 23, 33, 42, or 50 years of age.Depressive symptoms were measured using the Psychological subscale of the Malaise Inventory; frequency of physical activity, by questionnaire.Number of depressive symptoms (on a scale of 0 to 15 items), depression (defined as being in the top 10% for symptoms at 23, 33, 42, or 50 years of age), and frequency of physical activity (times per week).At most ages, we found a trend of fewer depressive symptoms with more frequent activity; for example, per higher frequency of activity per week at 50 years of age, the mean number of symptoms was lower by 0.06 (95% CI, −0.09 to −0.04). In longitudinal analyses, activity was associated with fewer symptoms from 23 to 50 years of age (per higher frequency of activity per week, symptoms were lower by 0.06 [95% CI, −0.07 to −0.05]), and the magnitude of association did not vary with age (P = .21 for interaction). Those who were inactive at 23 years of age and remained inactive 5 years later showed no change in symptom level (mean difference, −0.01 [95% CI, −0.04 to 0.02]); those increasing activity to 3 times/wk had a lower mean number of symptoms (mean difference, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.22 to −0.15]). Such differences equate to estimated reductions in odds of depression by 19%. A longitudinal relationship observed between symptoms and activity weakened with age (P &lt; .001 for interaction). Mean activity among those with no symptoms at 23 years of age and 5 years later was higher by 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.64) times/wk; in those with 1 additional depressive symptom, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.49-0.56) times/wk. Activity frequency did not differ among those with no symptoms at 43 years of age who subsequently had 0 or 1 symptom at 48 years of age. Associations for depression were generally similar to those for the full symptom spectrum.The relationship between activity and depressive symptoms was bidirectional, albeit more persistent during adult life in the direction from activity to depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that activity may alleviate depressive symptoms in the general population and, in turn, depressive symptoms in early adulthood may be a barrier to activity.}, number={12}, journal={JAMA Psychiatry}, author={Pinto Pereira, Snehal M. and Geoffroy, Marie-Claude and Power, Christine}, year={2014}, month=dec, pages={1373–1380} }

However, procedures used for sampling, data processing, and analysis are not consistently reported in the literature. The wide variability in how actigraphy is reported makes it difficult to compare findings across studies. The procedures and reporting methods from 21 studies that used actigraphs to assess sleep and wake in adult patients with cancer are reviewed to highlight the differences in reporting strategies. Patients with cancer were chosen to illustrate the methodological challenges related to procedures and reporting in one population. The aim of this article was to advance standards of information presented in publications to enable comparisons across research studies that use actigraphy. Specific methodological challenges when using actigraphy in research include instrumentation, selection of pertinent variables, sampling, and data processing and analysis. Procedural decisions are outlined and discussed, and suggestions are made for standardized actigraphy information to include in research reports. More consistent procedures and reporting will advance the science of sleep, daytime activity, and circadian activity rhythms and their association with other health-related variables.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Pain and Symptom Management}, author={Berger, Ann M. and Wielgus, Kimberly K. and Young-McCaughan, Stacey and Fischer, Patricia and Farr, Lynne and Lee, Kathryn A.}, year={2008}, month=aug, pages={191–199} }

Ratings of 54 English and 52 Swedish patients on a 65 item comprehensive psychopathology scale were used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness in the combined sample. Ratings on these 17 items for 64 patients participating in studies of four different antidepressant drugs were used to create a depression scale consisting of the 10 items which showed the largest changes with treatment and the highest correlation to overall change. The inner-rater reliability of the new depression scale was high. Scores on the scale correlated significantly with scores on a standard rating scale for depression, the Hamilton Rating Scale (HRS), indicating its validity as a general severity estimate. Its capacity to differentiate between responders and non-responders to antidepressant treatment was better than the HRS, indicating greater sensitivity to change.
